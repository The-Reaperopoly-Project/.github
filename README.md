“The Reaperopoly Project”

The board game is not just the beginning, it is the scene to which we set the future development of the minds of young entrepreneurs. We invigorate the seeds of knowledge and plant them with a vision of a sustainable future.

“The Reaperopoly Project” encompasses the ideals of business and money management, to talk to us through capitalist games of monopoly. We live in a capitalistic society from which it created this mindset of consumerism which has endured for several hundred years a form of tyrannical colonialism that has not served its people’s best interests, but the interests of profits and politics alike.

“The Reaperopoly Project” has grown from being a simple board game into becoming a first customer of the new industry of creating bio renewable products and bioplastics from Puerto Rico, the idea being that we will take our agricultural waste to create bioplastics.  As we supplant single use plastics with biodegradable plastics embedded with seeds, we shall fulfill our mission to truly reap what you sow.

Through those bioplastics we will actually impregnate the land with seeds you seeds you sow, allowing us to reproduce so there are four as the game itself would be made for cycle materials the entire game itself shall you take any rapidly and throw it in the dump it shall sprout food grow food from its components the idea here is that the Reaperopoly project is taking monopoly concept and reinvigorating the world with how do we do things over the right way. The way that sustains our future for families, for the environment, for our river and our hearts there's nothing I would say, other than love that is the core value to come forward.

The Reaperopoly revival is not to be a thing solely for profit, profit is just what comes from doing good business.  Sustainability isn't a byproduct, sustainability isn't a core value, sustainability isn't just a necessity. I demand it is our exoskeleton as is our exoskeleton it is our framework is our body to reach with you must have full systems analysis of the problems we are faced with and the perceptions the stakeholders and each of the people in that and this take holders not being disclosed with money not just being those with out of voice those with a voice and those are the figurehead no symbols and symbology are all part was mixed when we properly all of it it's more than one way just say I love you

I seek to raise funds not just to create a board game but to create a movement, that you and I can inspire the imagination in people's minds. As children we were taught to play games with symbols that reflect the troubles we will face as adults. Therefore, there are Barbie Dolls driving cars to meet men whose games are about buying / collecting property.

Reaperopoly aims to spread education with the child further than that to educate them to understand the full cycle of where you come from, to where are you going, and there's impacts to the cost of every single action done as an individual.  As a collective, the Reaperopoly project aims to help inspire the hearts and minds of everyone out there, to just sit back and think about the future what's possible and to realize that unless we give up on being entirely about ourselves that the end of the day probably nobody left to play with that entirely
reap what you sow into a world brought on machines and then I think they will come for us all.

“People sometimes make mistakes” (Wargames, 1983)

Therefore, we play movies for years that we laugh about, when we should shed tears. I for one do not wish to be around for the Terminator years. I wish to be around for the years the Reaperopoly has been started on. Our generation of people who care about one another respect one another, and their differences embrace the unique talents to be their strength, the inner strength of people, strength that bonds us and allows us to overcome the fact that our predecessors have set us on along a trajectory to which humanity cannot survive. The Reaperopoly project is my way of answering the call, a call that's been started by many eco warriors across the world for so many years. The same call that people such as Elon Musk have made quite clear to us that we need to plan for a second home because it's obvious the way we're going is a real risk that we lose at all.

I shall not let us fall.  

Instead, I ask you “Do you want to play a Game?” (Wargames, 1983). 
Wouldn’t you prefer a good game of Reaperopoly with me? 

Will you plant a seed of hope?  Nothing more, than that just a seed of hope with me. 

I leave you with a quote from a man far greater than I, Fred Rogers inspired myself and many of you to become good neighbors. Therefore, “Won’t you be my neighbor?” in this new land of Reaperopoly.  It is the work of great people like Mr. Rogers that I owe my dedication to loving humanity and the hard work of my Mother as my inspirations to which I am eternally grateful.

I love you, and to each one of you I wish you a goodnight

Sincerely,
The Reaper, with Love and Honor

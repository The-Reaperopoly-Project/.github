 Okay, so time out the time lock kitchen safe thing. So the idea would be to create one, we could 3D print called the t minus. So take the idea of a time lock safe, but instead we make it a sphere to make it more of a physical challenge. Because the idea of the time lock safe as it currently stands is just commercialized garbage. Because the entire idea is that you make the base of it super rakeable plastic to force you to buy a new one. Which I get the model, it makes economic sense, but it doesn't make environmental sense. It doesn't at all make logical sense. But if you're trying to, you know, work on human conditioning here to fight a craving, or something like myself, it's needed to be more challenging than something I just solved. The butter knife in two seconds. Like, I crack this bit to open in my literally two seconds. So I think by making it spherical, we could have more structural rigidity to it. But there are 3D plastics out that are flexible. So I'm thinking using like a flexible filament to this. I could make this into like a frustrating thing. If you're in a terrible part, you should make it really frustrating to do it, or just complicated. So I'm thinking about setting like the time pieces. Maybe it could be like that doctor in your kid, where you know you got to reach in, press the buzzer or whatever. You know, make challenges. Yeah, make challenges for the brain. That way it's a distraction which helps to fight the craving. There's a good impression. Yeah. So it changes it almost into a type of play. You know, so I'm trying to find it. How many energy do you have for this? Yeah. So like I put my cigarettes in this thing. For example, you know, that's great use case. We'll be cigarette quitting. I put my cigarettes in it and you know, I have to solve the puzzle or pieces to get this thing to come apart for me to get my cigarette. And it's got a time lock on it. So I could do it just like that thing does with the dial, the set it, or the way it physically moves keeps increasing the time limit on it. So I was thinking, on a gyroscope, you know, as a ball moves, we increase the time just like that wheel does. You set the wheel on the kitchen safe thingy. If you move it after it's been locked, it just increases time and it spins real easy. So the whole thing is meant as a consumer trap. And when you look at the actual thing, it's literally the way the time locks up, it's set to be a trap to try to play off of human psychology. The people that are fighting their cravings, they're trying to utilize psychology to get the force them into rebying it. So it's more of a plastic waste. You know, you get people to have to repel your safe and repel your product because they broke the damn thing, the process. You know, I'd rather have a fucking subscription model or some shit. If we could send you, oh, that would be it. Using bioplastics, what if you had a subscription model or it sends you a new puzzle every month? Or something to lock your stuff into? Was it a biodegradable plastic? Because I've seen one of the things I saw on YouTube was, there's these biodegradable... So we're working, everybody. But there's these biodegradable plastic that we've finished. I've been watching where they put seeds in the plastic. So you could replant forests and shit like that. Traditional homes, though, I think you could make it where the seeds built into it or herbs. You know, simple small plants that are super cheap, super easy. You know what I mean? You're starting to think multi use kind of ideas. I just have, because Steve's supposed to give me this 3D printer on Sunday, I'm like trying to think of like nifty things I could like 3D print. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Because remember, I did 3D printing with school and, you know, it was great and all, but like... I have limitations. I got 100% in class, so I'm pretty certain it clicks with me. If not, your curriculum just sucks because once again, I got 100% in it. And my ship was 10 times more complex than anything anybody else did in class. That's my first time modeling. Yeah, I mean, maybe 3D modeling is really where I should be looking at. That's some of the career I've known. That's the thing, Miami. Yeah. Staphyly cutting edge. I don't think Miami's where I need to be though for those kind of things though. That's the thing I can't keep coming to is that this school just doesn't... The program's just not strong enough. Like... What, I mean, it's weird that you didn't even hear about Blake, but then we're down there and we see somebody at your college doing it before it, but... It's not the communication, not the... Well, you mean like how we have a college that has a major in communications? But our school doesn't communicate? Yeah. Method acting. But yeah, no, I was thinking about the time I was safe too. I could also make like Bluetooth support to it. So I could... You could lock it from your phone kind of thing. Okay. Anybody who moves it touches it. Like I only need more tactile. The problem I run into is I would be reusing the price point. And I don't want to put a bunch of plastic garbage in the world. But if I could do it with a biodegradable plastic, it would be even better. Because this is supposed to be breakable. I could do it with a biodegradable plastic. Because it doesn't... It's purposely not meant to be the strongest thing. At some point you want them to be able to break into it. Like somebody trying to get over their cravings, it's a process for humans. You know, I have to think of it as an animal. It's training. It takes time. That's my thoughts on it. And it's something that we could print with a 3D printer. Pretty easy. Hmm. Hmm. I think it would be... Very cool. A biodegradable plastic. A little piece of this. A tactile interaction. Use magnets to put the pieces together to create electrical contacts to solve the puzzle. With our Dreno board to power the time lock safe. This could also be used as a home hub or router for a matter of network. Rebippling. Make our pieces biodegradable to fit with the theme. By doing biodegradable plastics with the seeds and pregnant them, that would lead to our message of reap which is so. Such that we'd be sticking with the theme and branding.

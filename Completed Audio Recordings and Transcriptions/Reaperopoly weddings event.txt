 Rebroccoli. So, I want to make the game have the ability to be more of a social media platform. So, you play it normally the kids, just do the monopoly piece. I think it's adults you have it as a social media platform, like you get invited to a rebroccoli, a rebroccoli man, and you can manage things like a wedding, such that you're cracking the code by solving puzzles and questions about the other side to crack the code like steal a wedding vows with a gift list and playing for awards on the table. We can make a whole bunch of different mechanics around what's up for prizes. Say that you don't have wedding gifts, you know, who buys water and gets what? A lot of different options as a platform, but they are doing their own wedding to be huge. That's a huge fun. It does one more thing. So you're playing with the game digitally during the event. So if you were going to interact with the platform, it's going along and essentially the game to earn prizes, to unlock things thoroughly to the wedding itself. Raffles and shit. And you do some research to this.

 Reaperopoli. So one of the key things with language translation in a Reaperopoli universe is the idea of having a universal translator baits into the Reaper languages and the source go to the universe of Reaperopoli, meaning that there'll be a mechanism and test cases for where we can define eugeneric universal translator standard which creates a interface so we can use dependency injection primarily starting to see sharp the actual code that allows us to inject our understanding of a universal translator which can take in effect essentially languages as they get defined either being fictional or real or alias based on how they come about the Reaperopoli universe and how this code base being generated such that both fictional and real languages and their translations can be entered such that there could be a translation between Reaper to English to British English to see sharp to see plus plus to Pearl to Java to Chinese and backwards and forwards of that allowing that each of the translations is based upon the definition of the word from the viewpoint of each instance based in that timeline so it sticks with our home mantra of an idea of allowing time travel and time words and super abilities to exist means that if you can go back in time and change the definition of a thing or change the meaning of a word or the events during a gameplay change the meaning of it or in the example of law like the United States you know sourcing archives of like what's publicly accepted law and making it such that in our game that the Reaper version of American English you know there's is really an alias for American English that's based on a Reaper instantiation or instantiation of if you converted English through using Universal Translator with Reaper and Hulchete I business as to how it would get created to create that derived language that version of each of these things so that so essentially you've got a continuously variable instance that grows the stuff you know I expected the code plays it's going to create just thousands upon thousands of variations of code changes that happen just from the various AIs and NPCs and players playing along in the game that will create these source code changes to each of these various levels that contribute to truly growing them over time I hope this lets us leverage out having a small scale of team of brilliant and gifted programmers that truly understand the vision of the company being able to help curate and have that voice from the inside as we develop a system that interacts with the world in a whole the ideas to create unity and create as much global peace as possible through creating global understanding meanwhile creating in the game space our own Wabba AI's that are based on you know the Grim Reaper character playing as playing those war games for countries like the United States or for playing for Reaper Opliander whatever entity we want to come up with whatever construct we want to play with in the game dynamics and the whole reason for their being this huge dojo and why we talk about a service level the development of various AIs and the utilization of woods off the shelf machine learning verse handwritten and exploring those concepts and playing those dojos and having these different AIs play out very simple games to begin with playing Tik Tok Tok with one another playing monopoly chess you know break out you know treat fighter etc and playing all of these mini games and these all being mini games that you can play in the Reaper Opli RPG space where you go in and put on your VR helmet and play at a stand up arcade or play at somebody's house playing on the Reaper video game console at home and that console could change in style and appearance similar to how we have the different consoles come out in real life other various video game manufacturers is where utilizing our idea of Reaper aliases you know the Nintendo entertainment system may be called the Reaper Entertainment System inside of our catalog but the data as to what the original was which would be Nintendo Entertainment System having that alias would be mapped in our data set and we mapped against the raw here is in reality we saw of say what Nintendo was what its releases were and we make that Reaper Opli with parodied versions of events of creating our own version of the idea of like those video games those releases those characters and so on that get created from these pop cultural pieces and that allows us to define them in our space because in our space of Reaper Opli the mind of society and how it grows is your reflection of what I feel from my perspective is my character what developed and I want there to be as using as many data sources as possible for raw source data that's based on truth and then allowing us to create characters and amateurs in our world that shapes by the individual writers and programmers and players they're involved to reflect what they personally experienced so you know based on their movie watching history their book reading history where they went to school etc and having those events reflected in the timeline their characters in the game and that going back to reflecting upon what information they make available it's the AI that's running as their character and their opinion of that world and what aliases and changes and changes the definitions of different words of what things meant to them at those points of time what they do mean such as we could have simple things of surveys that we send out to people and people that represent these various elements of the Reaper Opli namespace and game space where we say hey the movie read on what did that make these things mean to you and it could be a list of each of the different actors and characters and plot line elements in it in the viewpoints down to the fact whether or not you felt that this movie portrayed the Russians as being the evil guys the bad guys were the good guys were the Americans with the victims and so on so forth to where kind of like how we take TV ratings and the Nielsen ratings but being in the Reaper Opli world kind of a way of gathering essentially what I did like I worked at plant feedback at home where we took complaints against businesses we did a lot about raising user viewpoint I'm wanting to come up with a way to where we can create quizzes in feedback ways that could be part of the Reaper dynamic and the Reaper conversation on the social media platforms and the convert conversational platforms that will go on on the chat servers inside of the game remember there's a lot of stuff that gets played by the different AIs in this well as you own and control different characters that are in the world you could choose which chatbot or which AI you know and in the commercial ones you pay to play free ones that would be free or you know mobs of versions where we're just taking it over you know based on the different token economics in the gameplay to allow you to change that world you know the whole idea is that this is going to look like a reflection of society with a lot of the content being generated out so it's gonna look really freaking weird in the beginning like it's it's not gonna make a lot of clear sense until we're at the point that we've got like a GPT three style level or above an image creation and audio creation and license copies as well as what we find in public domain we're gonna search a lot for what's public domain to start with and try to source as much as possible of public domain data sets to truly build out R.A.I. or audio or video sourcing non copyrighted or royalty free stuff and putting their licenses and their license terms to be valid things in the rewraply space so that we are honoring them correctly and able to utilize that data trove as part of what feeds into this whole overall system this is why you know these data sources there are gonna be truly public sources non profit stuff stuff that we don't own the license of that is public we've part of open source databases that we have out there that'll be available in our public get re forget style repose that could be data sets that other people access and leverage upon and build things based on it by following those sources and utilizing the AI abilities and the chatbot abilities and the cogeneration abilities based on these public sources that we carry this goes back to why we have so many different repos and levels of security to the repose to or source control and that data is particularly protect how this develops be

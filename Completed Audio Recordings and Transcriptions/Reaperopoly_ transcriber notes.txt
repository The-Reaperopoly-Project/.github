 So, expanding on how I want these transcripts to be done, and this is a follow up to the one I just did is really long in and deaf, but every morning just detailed aspects. So this message is designed primarily to James Slor, it's my mom, or whoever else is helping with this initial transition. I want to do your manual transcripts we talked about once again with at the same time placing this raw data into one bucket, into one side of the database, as well as placing into another one your curated versions of what you transcribed as well as what we can transcribe by doing an automated process whether we're using you know macOS, automated tooling or using cron jobs or microservices or any other service to where maybe is AI, script or whatever you want to call it, whatever the script is running where it would play like these voice recordings of mine or video recordings and utilize dictations, say a word or a better product to create automated versions of that text as well for data mining and creating an automated process that follows along for creating you know or get better and best of each of these steps because I know this takes a lot of time, I know this is something that it's going to take a lot just to manage making these ideas from being ideas to being actionable steps yet along the complete nightmare it's going to be of prioritizing these steps, I don't expect this to take long, sorry I don't expect this to take a long time implement but I don't expect this to take a long time to create as much of this initial conversion of these initial ideas of mine in creating very just high level abstract visionary documents to begin with and start refining that down and let us build in that process as it becomes prudent but to have a lot of source material to go back to because keeping creativity with a large project like this will become increasingly difficult, it's not have developer burnout, it's not have people lose excitement on it and having developers that take an interest in the pieces where it makes sense that's going to be a very hard sell over time and that's why I want the ability to from my end at least create test scripts yet alone code changes where I want to to help iterate along you know the parts I may see as special or I may choose to contribute to but leaving a lot of flexibility I truly want there to be a large voice to this but not to have my own drown out it's taking me years to get to the point of being able to do this I'm the one funding it to begin with I'm going to have a disproportionate size voice but it's not one out of malice it's one out of that that base ownership to the concepts the idea the originality of this but I would be nothing in life without the influence of the world the opportunities like the opportunities that came to me from having you know a mom that carried the put me in the private school to schools that you know protected me and able me to grow and eventually return to college and the great benefits of having people like source tutoring and Jacob source and his team and helping it be a positive experience that has been led to us hiring of alumni of being involved with more alumni and you know people like Dizim is joining us you have been some of that I met through my experience my nap my apple and I'll say I'm a him you're seeing and a reflection of that gratitude.

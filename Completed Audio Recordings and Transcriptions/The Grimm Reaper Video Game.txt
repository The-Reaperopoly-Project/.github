 So, things like video games, one of the key possible names here could just be the Grim Reaper with a double M. And be the fun story as it adventures of my little Grim Reaper character when he does. I can start out with a little 2D version, make it, you know, not a super Mario Brothers, but something similarly fun for learning how to do gaming. Let's get a fun character to play with and we'll play into what we do for the animations for learning how to animate to do videos for YouTube and so on. Thank you for your hard work with Big Steel Productions on this one, Shoutout to Alex Steel. I'll give you my animation, oh there's my boy.

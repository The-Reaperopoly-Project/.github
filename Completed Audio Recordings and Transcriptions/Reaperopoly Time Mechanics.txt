 We're probably time mechanics. So going back to the whole concept of how time travel and time once in the work in we're probably is every player is going to have their attributes knowledge of time, but there's multiple clocks. There will be a reality time clock which will be tied from our servers out to the public time servers that we use like the single of our computers in reality. There will also be the reproproperly clock which will be tied to the instance of the game you're playing and then there will be the perceived time clock which will be based on the player itself how they have manipulated time to see what their time limit is. So in the game when you're playing along normally and reproproperly and you're not doing things like changing time it's all going to be in that main branch of code but when you create a time event essentially what's going to happen is this is going to cause in the back end you're an instance of read your optically to fork a branch off of the reproproperly code and allow you to make those edits as a time ward. As anyway it's done anything was time so that we can see the effects of what changes in the time line and those various paradoxes that ends up being reflected in the actual code behind the game engine that's running itself and the code being generated. This all goes back to the supermata of this whole thing of making it a reality that you go back in time and change these things but you change it where you is your player and your viewpoint if you unlock those abilities you become a time ward if you earn those things in the game allows you explore that meanwhile the main trunk of the game is moving along being generated based on what's considered fact as well as what is canon to the grim reaper brand. This is why we're properly expands on the five window adventures eAV website specialization model into where that's going to be specialized based on time and instance etc. adding these different layers to the onion that affect what values come back to each of the various objects and pieces of code throughout the entire system and you know this is all based on the stuff that's going back to at least 2005 prior to that my work in game board came from two blast analysis for a creative very early machine learning before she learned with the thing. So wanting to recreate that aspect. This is what we can make a little fun to this is that you know say you're playing many cards of the game and you get a card that allows you to be a grim reaper for five minutes you know something like that where all of a sudden it enables those powers and you can go in and do these changes the time or take over whatever you want or killing off characters and doing things you know lame us to do cool little Easter arguments to this stuff making it being a reward so in the game you know if you choose to go in the casino and gamble and play game reaper properly and you choose to play against grim reaper you could put up as stakes these various things like you know stating that you want to be able to have the grim reaper as a goal and offering a for deal of like what you're willing to sell your soul of your sell your property is in control or money as a gamble. The whole idea is you know reaper what you sell and creating these various mechanics throughout different many games in the ecosystem similar like GTA 5 you know where you know you're running around card jacking but you stop at various places like your safe houses and stuff and do various things it's going to be very similar to that but expanded to a much great depth. I don't anticipate the role playing version of reaper probably to be a thing that rolls out anytime soon I'd like to get to playable free demo versions of it over the next several months but it's going to take quite a bit of time until we can truly generate worlds and levels that reflect the vision of importing this data so we might start with a level where we just map say for example the reaper probably bored would be just a city block and then we create a city grid or we create in New York we create a Cincinnati we create a neighborhood building up these levels and classes so that eventually we're able to import that data of what's publicly available of the true ownership of everything that's out there and see what we can data mine from these sources so that's going to take a large amount of time and a large amount of procedural generation so we do this by scaling it up and starting out with very small iterations and that's why we want to do our YouTube channels and developer channels to show kind of this iterative methodology doing test for development to where we're creating each of these steps in the process and documenting that and having our various developers and their characters and avatars speak to the idea behind it that's why I'm creating these voice memos and such to be source for positive reason material to draw on for creating these various episodes and it's going to take thousands of episodes to document this process as it builds out reaperoply as a game it could probably take a decade or more to finish out and it's literally I don't think finishing out to re really a concept it's probably basically a never end which would be great and it goes back to having kind of a subscription model ultimately wanting to open up to approved other reaper developers and reaper companies and utilizing our cryptocurrency and token economics to allow them to each have a voice in the creation of our metaverse of reaperoply the idea being here that you know this starts with my vision but the whole idea is building a game that reflects humanity reflects media and the effect of these things on us. Recreation of these meta events is going to be super deep to the point that in the game you're role playing along as a reaper and say you pick up a VHS type in a reaperoply land of war games. When you play once you play that tape in the game that fires off the series of events to where the ideas and the messages that we interpret from my viewpoint of viewing these movies and their effects become reality in reaperoply land such that if you look at the movie called hackers you know how he's fighting over the TV station and they fight over to tape supply those tapes being played as going to affect what information the various NBC characters throughout the world are exposed to and what events trigger. That's why the time mechanics makes such a dynamic interface to this. You know if you jump back in time and take over being a movie producer and stop the creation of a movie you stop the creation of Mickey Mouse or you stop the creation of the Terminator movies then those things don't occur but the grim reaper itself following the main storyline is going to follow my main timeline of my life path as this is ultimately my memoirs such that my experience and exposure to these movies and concepts is reflected in the code such that you know when the Terminator movie came out that's an idea of it could be created and would spawn those elements as being real things in the real timelines as if watching the movies made the reality such that one of the levels of the being you know me as Robert Somerville and Lord Somerville as a level being my mom's house playing in that initial computer terminal my initial TV my video game consoles and stuff will be actual elements that affect how the world generates and what it fires off to make things being reality such that you know if you're role playing as Robert Somerville you choose to watch the Terminator movies well then when the game clock of every broccoli clicks 1999 the events of Terminator happens where the Terminator spawns in where those elements occur because of that similar like the Matrix and stuff like that to where their fictional timelines tie into the games mechanics of where the time clocks for at and what's enabled so it creates a very dynamic universe and experience so you can role play through living the life of the default Grim Reaper as well as what each person's individual view what would be so you know the starts with being a game of my Grim Reaper character but I'm wanting to ultimately have the same capabilities and impacts be contributed by people like consider Reapers in my own life that define their own characters and their own experiences and have a framework to work together to co lab and script these things so that's why we're doing open sourcing to allow people to develop out their own versions of this stuff and looking at using the git methodology of pushing pull requests to where we possibly accept in to the main branch outside pieces of code and it's been generated outside viewpoints to create the depth that represents the knowledge of not just like the American perspective but hopefully getting the Eastern world and other worlds to be able to express themselves and allow us to have a model that lets us explore reality in rebroccoli world as we play the capitals game taking over control of everything that be a true reflection of society humanity you know the concept of dualizing movies and media and how the effects the events of things is in a key mechanic I want to be able to express this so if you're playing as Lord Summer when you put a tape into my TV and my mom's house that kicks off the event of that movie being watched enables all the events to fire and make their changes to the world and the perception of the world based on the understanding of the changing perspective of the grim reaper as the grim reaper is exposed to it so the grim reaper chooses to not watch these movies to not play video games or not interact with things it will completely change how each person's individual grim reaper acts and how they play along how their Lord Summer how they sing the sully and etc plays in the game

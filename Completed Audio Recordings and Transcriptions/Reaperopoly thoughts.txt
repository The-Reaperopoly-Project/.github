 Rear robberly. Get back to the basics. Remember, about running the charity campaigns, prove the stake has now happened with the Ethereum network. This time I start working on building the reapers of cryptocurrency. Moving to that stage of it. So, we go back to the original idea of trying to make reaperoply basically a verb in the green reapers universe. Reaper what you saw. Remember to look into trying to work with the new game or new gate casino or whatever it's called in Oxford. They play poker to try to reaperoply this game there as well. Something where they could stake it digitally. They do the raking and everything else. They earn the dollars per hour. Reaperoply is just another one of the games provided there and we sponsor it. That would give us a home base for it. It would be easy to sponsor and part grow up with them. We just sponsor table at the facility for new gate. Maybe we work with them, come get them free web hosting or whatever as a Benny. That would be a good easy drawing point to get reaperoply going. Give us a physical location to start selling it. It could also work with the comic book store in Oxford to start selling copies of reaperoply out of there.

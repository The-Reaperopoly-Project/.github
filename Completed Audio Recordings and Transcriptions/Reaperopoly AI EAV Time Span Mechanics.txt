 Rebropbling. We want to instants for you objects from movies and themes ideas such as a construct of back to the future by creating a time machine in Rebropbling such that it changes where you're at the timeline. This goes back to the E of E database model that I've extended with the system with the website where you just extend that out to having additional filter parameters based on time. That way the objects interact differently based on the perception of what time they're in and allows us to run Rebropbling as a whole ecosystem in name space continuously and allows the AI to generate events because its data sets or arrange based on these filters. That's why we're going to use a RangoDB as a multi document database server with the filters to complete this idea. That allows us to enable truly having the functions of the future happening with the DeLorean as well as having the time Lord and as Tartus would be a thing Rebropbling and Lord Summary as the hacker. That's how we have these better events happen in our universe. The code will literally read out the names of these fictional characters like Diaz and Concepts that we grew up in loving. We use the variable names in the code as we express them and represent them in the Rebropleyverse.
